Tic Tac Toe has fully working functionality and the architecture of the code is carefully planned with separate data classes, services, manager and game object to link it together. Actively used git branches during my codign and named them after functionality or service that was developed. Did also add extra functionality by developing a darkmode option that is comfortable to look at.

<h3 align="Left">Backend</h3>

  
<h3 align="Left">Branches</h3>
Every branch is named with function and then the specific task (functionality/task). I decided to not delete any branches after merging on the basis that it is easier to view the progress of each branch without having to go into history. 


<h3 align="Left">Unit testing</h3>
I have used unit testing to create and transform data by checking for the expected format and further checked for correct data in different cases by asserting into my data classes.
