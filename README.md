<h3 align="Left">Branches</h3>
Every branch is named with function and then the specific task (functionality/task). I decided to not delete any branches after merging on the basis that it is easier to view the progress of each branch without having to go into history. 


<h3 align="Left">Unit testing</h3>
I have used unit testing to create and transform data by checking for the expected format and further checked for correct data in different cases by asserting into my data classes.
